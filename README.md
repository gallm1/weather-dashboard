## Description

--barebones html created
--barebones css file created
--linked jQuery
--linked bootstrap
--connected the openweathermap api with my key
--spent a ton of time on the javascript file and actually mananged to get a minimum viable product.
  needs some major clean up and could probably improve the code quite a bit.  Feels like i went the long way on quite a bit of it.
--did play around with the project functionality in git hub (just a slight bit - plant to utilize that more in the future.)
